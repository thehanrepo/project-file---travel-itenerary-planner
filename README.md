The goal of the Travel Itinerary Planner Database project is to improve
and speed up the process of booking travel. Three main features are
included in this database-driven application: hotel reservations, trip
packages, and trip bookings.

By providing information such as the Trip ID, Trip Name, Start and End
Dates, and Budget, users can make reservations for travel packages
through the Trip Packages module. This feature offers pre-made packages
to make organized trip planning easier.

Users can make reservations for hotel rooms by providing details such as
the Hotel ID, Name, Location, Nightly Price, and any available Deals
through the Hotel Bookings component. It is convenient for users to book
hotels based on their preferences.

The Booking ID, Traveller Name, Destination, Departure and Return
Dates, Hotel Name, Flight Number, and Car Rental Company are all
managed by the Trip Bookings section.

The menu that allows you to book hotels, trip packages, or an entire trip
is simple to navigate. The application can be closed at any time by users.
MySQL is used by the system to store and retrieve data, ensuring
performance and data integrity. This project makes the process of
planning, customizing, and booking travel plans straightforward for users,
making the trip enjoyable and convenient overall.
