The goal of the Travel Itinerary Planner Database project is to improve
and speed up the process of booking travel. Three main features are
included in this database-driven application: hotel reservations, trip
packages, and trip bookings.

The Booking ID, Traveller Name, Destination, Departure and Return
Dates, Hotel Name, Flight Number, and Car Rental Company are all
managed by the Trip Bookings section.

The menu that allows you to book hotels, trip packages, or an entire trip
is simple to navigate. The application can be closed at any time by users.
MySQL is used by the system to store and retrieve data, ensuring
performance and data integrity. This project makes the process of
planning, customizing, and booking travel plans straightforward for users,
making the trip enjoyable and convenient overall.
